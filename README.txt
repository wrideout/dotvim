Execute the following commands in order to install to your ~/.vim file:

    # Install the git repository
    $ git clone git://github.com/wrideout/dotvim.git ~/.vim

    # Create symlinks
    $ ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

It should be noted that this process will only work if ~/.vim is empty, and
~/.vimrc does not exist.  If this is not the case, then be sure to back up your
existing Vim configuration files:

    $ mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc_old
    $ mv ~/.vim ~/.vim_old

Once installation is complete, ~/.vim may be treated as a regulat git
repository, and therefore updated as such.
